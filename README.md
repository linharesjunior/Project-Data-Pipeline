# Project-Data-Pipeline

# Overview

This project involves an in-depth analysis of a dataset that provides detailed information on average rental prices in Barcelona from 2014 to 2022. Leveraging the Python programming language and the Pandas library, the project encompasses essential data preprocessing tasks, including data cleaning, handling missing values, and converting data types for effective analysis.

The analysis encompasses several critical aspects, including the exploration of:

1. Seasonal Price Fluctuations: Investigating how rental prices vary throughout the year, identifying seasonal trends, and understanding the impact of these fluctuations.

2. External Events: Examining how external factors or events may influence rental prices, providing insights into the market's responsiveness to changes.

3. Location-Based Price Variations: Analyzing how rental prices differ across various neighborhoods and districts in Barcelona, uncovering location-based trends and disparities.

4. Correlation with Average Wage in Spain: Exploring the relationship between average rental prices and the average wage in Spain, shedding light on economic factors affecting the rental market.

To enhance the dataset's richness, web scraping techniques are applied to gather supplementary information regarding the average salary in Spain over the years. This additional data is integrated with the original dataset to provide a more comprehensive perspective.

Moreover, the project involves consulting additional resources to gain a deeper understanding of various trends and patterns in rental prices. This may include referencing external sources and scholarly articles to enrich the analysis.

It's important to note that the dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/), a popular platform for datasets and data science resources. The combination of data analysis, web scraping, and external research contributes to a comprehensive and insightful exploration of Barcelona's rental market dynamics.

# Conclusion

Rent Trends:

Throughout the period of 2014 to 2022, the dataset reveals a noticeable and consistent upward trend in Barcelona's rental prices. However, an anomaly was observed in 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. During this unprecedented event, there was a temporary decrease in rental prices, reflecting the economic uncertainty and disruptions caused by the pandemic. The overall upward trajectory of rent prices, though interrupted momentarily, suggests a robust and resilient rental market in Barcelona.

Yearly Percentage Changes:

The data analysis highlights substantial variations in annual rent price changes. Notably, from 2021 to 2022, the average rent prices experienced a moderate 7.21% increase. This suggests a gradual recovery from the pandemic's impact, as individuals and families adapted to new living arrangements and economic conditions. However, the most remarkable observation is the sharp acceleration in rent price growth when comparing 2022 to 2023, where the increase surged to 18.71%. This surge may be indicative of various factors, including increased demand, supply constraints, or changes in economic conditions. The substantial jump in 2023 warrants further investigation to understand the driving forces behind this surge.

Stable Neighborhood Prices:

Analyzing the data also unveiled that specific neighborhoods in Barcelona have consistently maintained high rent prices over the years. This indicates the existence of stable and desirable residential areas where rental costs remain consistently high. Identifying these neighborhoods can be valuable for both renters and property investors seeking stable returns on their investments.

Wage Comparison:

An intriguing finding is the relatively minimal variation in salary trends when compared to the fluctuation in rental prices. While rent prices have exhibited notable changes over the years, the average wage in Spain has remained relatively steady. This suggests a divergence in economic dynamics, where rent prices may be influenced by factors other than average wage growth. Understanding the drivers of rent price changes beyond wage trends is crucial for a comprehensive view of the Barcelona rental market.

In conclusion, the analysis of Barcelona's rental market reveals a dynamic sector, characterized by upward rent price trends, yearly variations, stable high-price neighborhoods, and a unique economic relationship with average wage trends. The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the market in 2020 and the subsequent surge in rent prices in 2023 present opportunities for further research and market insights.
